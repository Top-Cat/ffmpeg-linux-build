ffmpeg-linux-build
==================

Builds a server install of ffmpeg, enabling rtmp, x264 libfdk_aac.

Released under GPLv3, but resulting binaries are not, and are not redistributable.

Inspired by, and parts used from (namely package checking), https://github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers
